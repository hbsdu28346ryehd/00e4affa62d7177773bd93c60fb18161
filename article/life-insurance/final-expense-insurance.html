                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Final expense insurance, also known as burial insurance or funeral insurance, is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for the expenses associated with a person's funeral and other end-of-life expenses. This type of insurance policy is typically purchased by seniors or those with health issues who want to ensure that their final expenses are covered without burdening their loved ones with the costs.
                    The coverage amount for final expense insurance is usually between $5,000 to $25,000, and the premiums are typically lower compared to traditional life insurance policies. Final expense insurance policies are often available as either a whole life or term life insurance policy, depending on the insurer.
                    Final expense insurance is designed to provide financial stability for the family members and loved ones of the insured, ensuring that the cost of funeral services, burial or cremation, and other end-of-life expenses are covered. It can also help cover outstanding debts and medical bills.
