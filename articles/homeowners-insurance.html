            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Homeowners insurance is a type of insurance
            that provides financial protection to homeowners in the event of
            damage or loss to their property, as well as liability coverage in
            the event someone is injured while on the property. Homeowners
            insurance typically covers damage caused by natural disasters,
            theft, and other hazards. Policies may also include coverage for
            personal property and living expenses if the home becomes
            uninhabitable. Homeowners insurance is usually required by mortgage
            lenders as a condition of the loan, and it's important for
            homeowners to understand the coverage and limitations of their
            policy to ensure they have adequate protection.

            What does homeowners insurance typically cover?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Homeowners insurance typically covers damage to the home and
            personal property caused by events such as fire, theft, and natural
            disasters. It may also include liability coverage in case someone is
            injured while on the property.

          </h5>
          <p>
            The amount of homeowners insurance you need depends on a variety of

            personal property, and the level of liability coverage you want.
            It's important to work with an insurance agent to determine the
            appropriate amount of coverage for your needs.
