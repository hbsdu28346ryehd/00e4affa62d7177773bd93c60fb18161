                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Insurance is a financial product that provides protection against financial
                    loss or damage caused by unforeseen events. It works by transferring the risk of loss from an
                    individual or organization to an insurance company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;An insurance policy is a contract between an individual or organization,
                    known as the policyholder, and an insurance company. The policyholder pays a premium to the
                    insurance company in exchange for coverage for a specific type of risk. If a covered event occurs,
                    the insurance company will pay out a claim to cover the loss or damage up to the policy limit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Insurance policies vary in terms of coverage, cost, and exclusions, so it's
                    important to carefully review the policy terms before purchasing insurance. By transferring the risk
                    of financial loss to an insurance company, individuals and organizations can protect themselves from
                    unexpected events and have peace of mind knowing that they are financially protected.

                    <span>#</span> Why do I need insurance?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Insurance provides financial protection against unexpected events, such as accidents, illnesses, or
                    disasters. It can help you avoid financial hardship and ensure that you have the resources to
                    recover from a loss.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h5 class="h5 sub-title" id="how-much-insurance-do-i-want">
                    <span>#</span> How much insurance do I need?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The amount of insurance you need depends on your individual circumstances, such as your age, health,
                    income, assets, and liabilities. It's important to assess your risks and determine the appropriate
                    amount of coverage to protect yourself and your assets.

                    <span>#</span> What is a deductible?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    A deductible is the amount of money you pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in.
                    For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible on your auto insurance policy and you get into an
                    accident that results in $5,000 in damages, you would pay the first $1,000 and your insurance
                    company would cover the remaining $4,000.
                </p>

                    <span>#</span> What is an insurance policy?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    An insurance policy is a contract between you and an insurance company that outlines the terms of
                    your coverage. It specifies the type and amount of coverage you have, the premium you pay, the
                    deductible you must meet, and any exclusions or limitations on your coverage.
                </p>
